TO ADD




Carleton said to the States General: "I put the States in remembrance first of the time, which if they did presently lay hold of, they would in an Italian business find the effect of an Italian saying, Chi tempo ha e tempo espetta, perde tempo. And then of the matter itself, wherein understanding that some of their admiralties imagine upon this occasion to capitulate for some particular privilege in the Gulf, I put them in mind how the doge and the Senate do once a year with much solemnity esposar il mare, and how jealous a Venetian is of his wife. Wherefore I advised them not to touch upon this string, if they thought to make good harmony with that State, for this I assured them would be no other than a rock upon which their treaty would suffer shipwreck."
