1676855	Reports that he has arrived in Stuttgart on Monday. On Tuesday, he had an audience with Duke Johann Friedrich of Würtemburg to explain the current situation with the Uskoks. The Duke informs him that the prince of Palatinate has written, in name of all the members of the Union, to the Emperor to find a solution. The Duke assures him that they will continue to support Venice, and signals that he has prevented levies of troops in his duchy. After his audience, Suriano discusses the plan of princes of the Union further with the counsellor Buwinckhausen, an old aquintance from his as a secretary time at the English court.
Suriano reports he has encountered some difficulties in obtaining an audience with the Margrave of Baden-Durlach. Upon his arrival in Durlach, the Margrave was leaving because his one year old daughter had just passed away. He also, however, took issue with how he was addressed by the Venetians, as he wants to be addressed as ’Serenissima’. A few men from his court visit Suriano to explain the matter, but Suriano rejects their arguments claiming the Venetian Republic only uses that title for the prince of Palatinate. Further Suriano reports that he has arrived in Heidelberg and he hopes to obtain an audience the next day. Meanwhile he was being entertained by a counsellor and met with Pieter Brederode, the Dutch ambassador to the German princes.
Suriano reports that he has received a warm welcome in the Palatinate and had an audience with Frederick, who warned Suriano not to trust the Spanish. Suriano thanks him for writing to the Emperor on behalf of the princes of the union. After the audience he is invited to dinner where he meets various important men in Heidelberg, with whom he discusses the reasons the passage of archduke Leopold in Stuttgart and his conversation with the Duke of Würtemberg. He says he will write a seperate letter about his conversation with Schomber (next letter). He concludes the letter by reporting that several captains have approached him to offer their services to the Venetian Republic. To this letter he attaches a response from the prince of the Palatinate and another ’scrittura’.
The Margrave was absent when Suriano arrived in Ansbach, so he was visited the counsellor Lencher to discuss politics. Suriano reports in cipher that Lencher proposes that a diversion is possible if the Dutch would be willing to break the Truce. Suriano further summarises his audience with the Margrave on that same topic, mostly in cipher. According to the Margrave, the u pcoming wedding in Heidelberg will be a good occasion for the princes of the union to discuss their strategy further. He ends the letter by saying that Count of Mansfelt was not present as he went to France. Attached is a letter by Joachim Ernst of Brandenburg, written on 10 July 1616.
In this letter Suriano describes the prince of Anhalt as extremely affectionate towards Venice. He is well-received upon his arrival in the city and in cipher he writes that the prince had promised him that members of the union will continue to think how they can support the Venetian Republic. He further reports that he travelled to Sulzbach to meet with August, Count Palatine of Sulzbach and that they discussed on-going politics.
In this second letter from Nürnberg, Suriano reports at length in cipher on a conversation he has had with Christian Anhalt and the ambassador of the Duke of Bavaria imperial politics and the troops levies in Bavaria on behalf of the Spanish troops going to Italian pensinula.He writes that he will continue his journey toward the Dutch Republic together with Vimes.
Upon his arrival in Cologne, he has heard that Anhalt is raising troops offering twice the salary of Spanish army. The newly wedded couple has travelled from Heidelberg to Cologne and are on their way to Cleves.
Reports his arrival in The Hague. The delegates of the States are in summer recess and he will have an audience this coming week. Oldenbarnevelt has also left the city, meanwhile Suriano has been received by prince Maurice. Maurice has inquired about the military strength of the Venetian Republic and of the Archduke Ferdinand as well as Duke of Savoy’s intentions to wage war against Milan and whether the Venetians will financially support Savoy. To inform Maurice properly Suriano asks for clarification on those points from Venice. He further writes that a lot of people think he has arrived to levy troops and some have already come to visit him and offer their services. He reports on the efforts by Johan Wassenhoven to levy troops, who had received patent letter from the Venetian Republic on 28 May 1616.
In this brief letter Suriano writes that Johann Ernst of Nassau offers his services to the Venetian Republic. He is an experienced commander and has the necessary funds to levy troops and transport them to Venice
In this letter, Suriano describes his first appearance in front of the States General explaining the war situation in Istria. He writes that he now awaits further instructions from Venice. Suriano complains about his financial situation as he had to leave Zurich so sudden and rent a house in The Hague. The French ambassador has to come to visit him and they discuss the French position towards Venice. The representative of Brandenburg has also come to pay his respect and the English ambassador Carleton is still in Spa. From Brussels, news that the confessor of the archdukes is going to Spain, the reason is not known. Colonal Schomberg, whom he had met on his way to The Hague, has passed away.
Suriano reiterates that he has already informed the Serenissima of the willingness of Johan Ernst of Nassau to enter their service. Since he has not yet received letters from Venice, he sends a document in which Johan Ernst of Nassau sets out his conditions for service and the number of troops he can raise. Suriano adds that he has translated this offer into Italian from French. Suriano reports that Johan Ernst has come to visit him to offer his services and provide additional information on his offer, which has been approved by prince Maurice. Regarding this offer, Suriano has some additional thoughts on the potential challenges for the Republic to consider which he also attaches to this letter. He further reports that soldiers are eagerly awaiting news whether he can levy troops in the Republic. He ends the letter with a note that Wassenhoven has come to visit him explaining why his levies have been delayed.
Suriano acknowledges receipt of letters from 13 August from Venice via Antwerp. Almost all members of congregation of Holland have gathered to find a solution for issue of predestination. Suriano reports that the representatives from Amsterdam want liberty of conscience. He further reports that news has arrived from Paris about the arrest of prince of Condé, but he wants to await further confirmation. Spinola is leaving to Spain via Italy, upon hearing this news from Brussels everyone was curious to find out the reason and this gave rise to the suspicion that the Duke of Savoy is co-operating with the governor of Milan. According to Suriano, many fear an attack on Geneve could be imminent. The archducal confessor is in Spain to reach a deal with the king on how to renew trade in Antwerp, there are rumours about potentially allowing freedom of consience in the city, but Suriano thinks this is unlikely. Carleton has returned from Spa and has expressed his willingness to help Suriano. Oldenbarnevelt has also returned, Suriano has visited him in his house. Suriano ends his letter by noting that the French king has sent six horses to give to prince Maurice and his brother Hendrick.

Carleton has come to visit Suriano to ask to recommend the services of Dingwall. Carleton further tells Suriano that it would be good for the Republic to raise some troops in England, and in case they would consider levying a regiment, he advises them to request permission from James I/VI.
Suriano writes that his arrival and levying of troops has led to more talk about a possible alliance between Venice and the Dutch state. He requests more guidance on the matter. He further raise the question of whether the Venetians would like to send an ordinary envoy to establish reciprocal diplomatic relations with the United Provinces. From France news that the prince of Condé has been arrested, he discusses fear amongst French in the Republic of a revolt. Further there is growing evidence that the Archdukes would like to negotiate about an extension of the Truce with the Dutch Republic
Suriano writes that recently letters have arrived in The Hague with updates on the situation in France which includes the king’s statement to parliament. In front of the States General, the French ambassador spoke in general terms about the required help from the United Provinces. In a conversation with Suriano, the ambassador entered into specifics stating they had to finance 5.000 troops. The States do not know what to do as they fear the Spanish might be involved in growing unrest in France. Bouillon has written to prince Maurice explaining the reason why the French princes are upset.

He attaches a translated copies of both these documents.
Suriano has reached an agreement with Johan Ernst of Nassau on the conditions which has been approved by the States General.

Wassonhoven is discontent and wants to receive some payments from the Republic for rental of ships. Lastly, he writes that he has seen a copy of printed document from letter by Emperor to Palatinate which he will send along with his letter.
In this letter Suriano reports that Johan Ernst wanted his troops to be garrisoned in town in Holland, but States General refused this and proposed fortresses along the Meuse and Tessel. The brother of Johan Ernst has arrived in The Hague from France, he also visited Suriano offering to serve the venetian republic by raising calvary. The offer is attached to the letter

Suriano reports that Pasini has travelled from Brussels to inform him personally about a few men who want to enter in the service of Venice. Chief amongst them is Thomas Studder, a 43 year old Catholic who had served under Colonel Francis Vere before entering the service of the archdukes. He is, according to Pasini, experienced engineer and able to speak seven or eight languages. Attached to the letter is a document detailing Studder’s career. There are seven standard-bearers who want to serve Venice and a reminder that if the Republic would wish Pasini would try to convince the Tuscan engineer Gamurrini to join their service.
He explains he was not able to write to Venice last week because he joined Johan Ernst of Nassau in Northern Holland, where 15 companies are ready to embark. He travelled to Amsterdam to settle some financial issues with the bankers. On his return in Amsterdam, he received the letter from 21 October 1616 instructing him to recruit an additional 1000 soldiers, he needs to request this and it might be difficult due to lodging issues.
