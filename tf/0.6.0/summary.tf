Upon his arrival in Durlach, the Margrave was leaving because his one year old daughter had just passed away. The Margrave also took issue with how he was addressed by the Venetians, as he wants to be addressed as ’Serenissima’.

Lack of letters but matters in Palatinate are not good with the sacking and burning of towns by Mansfeld’s troops. James is summoning parliament after hearing Digby’s account, presumably to change course.

Frederick has shown Suriano the intercepted letters of the Emperor, some doubt it will convince James I to act as Gondomar has a firm hold on the king. A minister from Geneva has arrived in The Hague to request their help against the Duke of Savoy. Twenty eight ships have set sail from Texel to the West Indies, but only eight are armed, the other twenty vessels are transporting Anabaptist sailors. Mercantile ships will set sail for Italy.

The admiralty of Amsterdam continues to request outstanding payments.
It continues to be extremely cold, prince Henry has returned from Nijmegen, but Spinola continues to be out in the field. William of Nassau has visited him as well as a German captain Hornet to offer his services to the Venetian Republic. Lack of money in the Dutch Republic to pay troops, causes a lot of problems with creditors. Confirmation that Christian the Younger has taken Amöneburg. Nethersole is travelling to England to secure support for Frederick, who might travel to Denmark. Reports that visited Maurice, who fears that James I might not continue his support as he had heard that the king was enraged with parliament after the remonstrance being presented to him. Acknowledges receipt of letters 3 December and is pleased to hear that Morosini has been elected as ambassador to replace him, awaits confirmation to communicate this to States General.
Letters from Venice have not yet arrived, he has also not yet received his salary and therefore it is difficult to conduct the public service for Venice. Equally a lack of certain news from Palatinate: Mansfelt has requested contributions from Speyer to Worms and even Strasburg. He is fortifying Germenshein and planning to construct a bridge. Due to the extreme cold, the war in Lower Palatinate has stalled as well: troops are in garrison. Someone from Waldeck came to solicit help from States General against Maurice of Hessen, who was occupying their entire territory. The Spanish hope the returning fleet from Indies will allow them sufficient resources to attack next season, the States of Holland are gathering to discuss financing the war. States General are doubtful about actions of James I. Awaits letters from Venice to have further news about the events with Grisons.

Received some of his letters dated 26 December from podestà of Bassano, who had recuperated the stolen letters and acknowledges receipt of 31 December and 1 January from Venice with news that governor of Milan will send troops to the Emperor to assist against Mansfeld. Suriano describes how the news of Venetian financial aid has been very well received in States General by quoting the words of the president at length. Van Aerssen has again tried to be excused from going to Venice. States of Holland will only reconvene in March.
Reports largely in cipher on the information he received from Maurice, which included that Tscerlaes is crazy (una pazza) and that he has refused to see her and no longer wants to discuss potential truce. Maurice also does not expect assistance from the Hanse cities and still awaiting news of conclusion of alliance with Denmark. The province of Holland is seeking money to sustain the war effort.

Read the letter (dated 7 January) during an assembly of the States General to inform them that Morosini, currently the Venetian ambassador in Savoy, will be travelling to Dutch Republic as soon as possible to take up position as the first Venetian resident ambassador.
Maurice is worried about the ’Spanish arts’, i.e. the attempts of the Spanish in trying to make the English into enemies of the Dutch. Apparently telling the king that the Dutch are attempting to colonise Virginia with the English company now demanding 12,000,000 florins as compensation. The news together with the loss of Jülich (although expected) afflicts the states general. Nethersol has retunred from England with the news that the king has decided to keep 8000 soldiers and 1500 cavalry in Palatinate, but not raise new troops. Attached are copies of intercepted letters which includes letter by Giacinto da Casale.
Reports he has been visited by Carleton who wanted to know whether Suriano had received word that Wotton had tried to dissuade the Venetian republican from hiring Mansfelt. Carleton had received instruction from the king that Wotton had acted without instruction from the king.
Due to the news from England, including instructions for Carleton to find money to maintain troops in the Palatinate, the States General have agreed to support Mansfelt for three months. Camerarius will travel to Denmark. Mansfelt also requested more money for his soldiers from king of Bohemia as well as title ’general of Palatinate’. Ends the letter with a few updates on war situation in the Low Countries with Spanish surveying territory to attack.
The incident at the imperial court between Venetian and Spanish ambassador was reported in the Amsterdam newspaper last week (in the manner described by Venetian government to its ambassadors, see the letter BHO 285).

The letter provides an overview of the war preparations and levies by either side in the war. Baron of Flechstein has arrived in The Hague for the 8000 remaining reichstaler to be paid to Baden and will raise a further 1000 man to join Christian the Younger. Ecclesiastical princes are also levying toops in Holy Roman Empire, especially Holstein and they might join the troops of Hendrik van den Berg.

Ships from East Indies have arrived in Zeeland and the States were warned that Earl of Arga (a scot serving the Spanish) had three ships to make prisoners of the troops they would find at sea to serve the Spanish.
Carleton received a letter from Wotton that Venice had decided to engage the Count of Mansfelt with 1000 ducats per month on the condition he continues to serve Frederick. Carleton had communicated this Frederick who was surprised that Suriano had not received any information on this matter. States General have given letters of exchange to pay Mansfelt for three months, continues stream of reports on levies in the Holy Roman Empire, the representative of Mansfelt continues to ask for more money and has also visited Suriano for the same reason.
Solmn entry of Spinola in Brussels after taking Jülich and idea that the next season they will attempt something on Sluis. The States are worried about the strained relationship between France and England related to events at La Rochelle. Dutch ambassadors in England have little hope to negotiate successfully with the king on matters of the East India trade. The Admiralty of Amsterdam is again requesting payment by Venice for ships sent few years earlier. Ends letter with pleas for payment of his salary (which had not been paid for a few months now) and reiterates he is living in a miserable state and has served the Republic loyally for more than 20 years.

Carleton praises the republic for its actions in protecting the German princes and their freedom.
Spinola is near Bruges inspecting a lot of sites in the region and probably preparing for an attack on Sluis. In Dutch Republic the realisation dawns that they have lost Jülich due to a lack of food. Hendrik van den Berg has joined forces with Anholt and will attack Christian the Younger. Collections have been held house per house to assist those besieged in Franchendal, the Genevans are thinking of doing the same. Continued negotations for the conversation of Berg. Dutch ambassadors request new instructions to negotiate in England. Milander has visited Suriano. Reiterates his plea to be paid his salary
The confirmation that Venice has enlisted Mansfelt has received praise from States General, Maurice and Frederick V. Reports that he discussed with Frederick Isabella’s attempt to offer Mansfelt favourable conditions to transfer his army to Bavarian service, who reassured him that the attempts were unsuccesful. Frederick will write a letter to that effect, the letter will be send to Wotton in Venice, but for their convenience is also attached. Included is also a letter about imperial attempt to punish Ansbach and other imperial cities. Still waiting for resolution from England, as Chichester is travelling to Heidelberg.

A variety of rumours related to a potential marriage between Stuarts and Spanish Habsburg; general sense in the Dutch Republic is that James is being played by the Spanish.

Others talk about a diversion in Burgundy. From Maurice he hears that Mansfeld had requested the daughter of Count of Emden in marriage, but they had refused.
He has visited prince Maurice because he received a letter from Admiralty of Rotterdam about the burnt ship (Three Kings). Reports on the dissolution of the Diet of Regensburg without a resolution for the Palatinate. The latest news from Holy Roman Empire is that the emperor will invade territory of elector of Saxony.

Elizabeth Stuart was upset, but it turned out to be false, they had arrived in Boulogne to travel to Spain. Maurice informs Suriano that the Spanish publicize in Switzerland that they have concluded a truce with United Provinces.

Suriano discussed the matter with Maurice who wants to keep the war away from United Provinces and inquires how much the allied want to pay Mansfeld per month. People fear his army and the damages they cause, Maurice thinks it will be better to have Mansfeld gone. Similary Du Maurier hopes that money will arrive in a timely manner to Mansfeld.
Instead of travelling to Mansfeld, Montereau wants to go to his home in the Champagne first. It raises the question whether the French are being truthful especially given that the latest letters from Paris mention that nothing is happening. Du Maurier is waiting for the details but nothing has arrived so far. Suspicions that capuchin friar sent by Baviaria to France has worked against the alliance. Fear for matters in Valtellina, also with new actions in France against the Hugenots in Montpellier. Equally little to be expected from England with Carleton’s latest proposition of James to States General. As a result of all this, rumours of truce with Spain are resurfacing. All this displeases Frederick, further reports of levies in Holy Roman Empire and Mansfeld is still in East Frisia.
States General thank Suriano for offering the Serenissima’s expression of relief that the plot against Maurice has been discovered. Maria van Utrecht and Anna Weytsen have requested mercy for Reinier van Oldenbarnevelt from Maurice and have tried to get help from the various ambassadors (including Suriano).
